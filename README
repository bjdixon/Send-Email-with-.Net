Exactly as the project is named. Sends email using .net (c#)

Bonus email validating regex. Although you shouldn't need this as the formatting is checked in the "try" block when the message adds the "to" property. The regex can be used client side before submitting.

string email = "address@domain.com";
Regex reg = new Regex(@"^([a-zA-Z0-9_\-\.]+)@((\[[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.[0-9]{1,3}\.)|(([a-zA-Z0-9\-]+\.)+))([a-zA-Z]{2,4}|[0-9]{1,3})(\]?)$");
bool valid = reg.IsMatch(email);
